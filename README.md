# Readibility Calculator

This program retrieves a desire file, parses the data, and calculates the readibility of the file using a multitude of readibility measures. To calculate readibility, the program keeps track of various things like Sentence, Word, and Syllable count.

This project was created with knowledge gained from Hyper Skill's Java track.
